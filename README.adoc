= FlowLogix Starter Archetype

This project is a Maven Archetype designed to create complete, testable projects for Jakarta EE. It provides a quick and easy way to set up a new project with a pre-configured structure and dependencies, following best practices.

== What is an Archetype?

A Maven Archetype is a project templating toolkit. It allows users to create new Maven projects from a predefined template. This "FlowLogix Starter Archetype" serves as that template.

== How to use this Archetype

To generate a new project using this archetype, run the following Maven command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.flowlogix.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=starter \
  -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST \
  -DgroupId=com.example \
  -DartifactId=my-new-project \
  -Dversion=x-SNAPSHOT
----

Replace `com.example`, `my-new-project`, and `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` with your desired `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` for the new project.

Upon successful generation, a new directory named `my-new-project` (or whatever `artifactId` you specified) will be created, containing your new project.

== Project Structure

The generated project will include:
*   A pre-configured Maven `pom.xml`
*   Basic Jakarta EE structure
*   Example unit and integration tests
*   Pre-configured CI/CD with Dependabot and GitHub Actions
